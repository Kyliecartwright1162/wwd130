        <h3>I am a incredibly bubbly, sunshine filled individual! I have the most wonderful husband, four wonderful children (Two full-time toddlers, & two part-time teens)
            and a border collie just for fun! I have been a graphic designer for over a decade, and became intrested in web design and development around three years ago. Learning all 
            that I could from books that I found, youtube, and anything that I could get my hands on about web design and development!</h3>
        <h3>I recently have recovered from a very serious medical crisis that kept me in the hospital for months. I had to stop everything and it made me very sad. 
            Because I had to ask my husband to withdraw me from all the classes that I was taking. I wondered why if these courses were something that I was inspired to do, then why
            was I so sick? I now understand that it was a blessing in disguise. Because of my illness I quit my job, prompting me to search for other employment. Now I have a better job that 
            gives me time to study, while also working on my career! It just goes to show that with a little faith and patience that even trials are all part of a divine plan.</h3>
        <h3>I am excited to meet and work with you all this semester!</h3>
